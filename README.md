Our project will be an internet site written in Python (server-side) and JavaScript (client-side).
The site is providing a comfortable and user-friendly environment for everyone who wants to exchange anything with other users that wants what he offers by using the "trading cycles".

The site suggest exchanging from various types of items like work shifts, personal items,vouchers and more.

The algorithm can work for a large number of users whenever there is a cycle in the graph which has x people and x items which each wants the other's items, the algorithm will find the largest cycle and then will make the exchange and will continue searching for more cycles for the items that was not exchanged yet. In the "worst case" for a participant, he will stay with his current item.
